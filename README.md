 supFL [40]: a distributed machine learning method which
performs independent supervised feature selection on
each of the K participants assuming that they all have
access to label information. [suggested configuration:
β ∈ {10−5
, 10−4
, ..., 10}]
• V-FedMV [6]: a vertical federated learning multi-view
method, which aims to propose a systematic solution for
federated multi-view learning. [suggested configuration:
βk = 4, ζk and η from 2
0
to 2
5
]
• MMVFL [26]: a vertical federated learning multi-view
method, which learns a separate model for each participant to make the learning process more personalized.
[suggested configuration: β ∈ {10−5
, 10−4
, ..., 10}, ζ =
1000 and η1 = 1000]
• supMVLFL [40]: a distributed multi-view learning
method, which performs supervised multi-view featureselection under a linear transformation framework. [suggested configuration: β ∈ {10−5
, 10−4
, ..., 10}]
